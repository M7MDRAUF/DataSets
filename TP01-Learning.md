- **Deployment Issues**: Docker containerization challenges, dependency conflicts, and cross-platform compatibility

### Team Dynamics:
- **Skill Level Disparities**: Varying proficiency in AI/ML requiring additional mentoring and knowledge sharing sessions
- **Time Zone Differences**: Potential scheduling conflicts for synchronous meetings and pair programming sessions
- **Workload Distribution**: Ensuring equitable task allocation considering individual strengths and learning objectives
- **Communication Gaps**: Technical discussions requiring clear documentation to prevent misunderstandings

### External Factors:
- **Academic Deadlines**: Concurrent coursework and commitments competing for time and attention
- **Technology Learning Curve**: Team members developing AI/ML skills while building production system
- **Dataset Constraints**: Working with large-scale data requiring optimization strategies not initially planned
- **Advisor Expectations**: Potential scope adjustments based on thesis requirements and feedback cycles

## Conflict Management

### Potential Conflicts:

1. **Technical Disagreements**:
   - **Scenario**: Conflicting opinions on architecture decisions, algorithm selection, or implementation approaches
   - **Example**: Debate between using SVD vs. Matrix Factorization for collaborative filtering
   - **Risk**: Delays in development; fragmented codebase; team frustration

2. **Workload Imbalance**:
   - **Scenario**: Perception that tasks are unfairly distributed; some members contributing more than others
   - **Example**: Full Stack developer handling both frontend and backend while others focus on narrow ML tasks
   - **Risk**: Burnout; resentment; quality degradation

3. **Deadline Pressure**:
   - **Scenario**: Approaching milestones causing stress; temptation to cut corners or skip testing
   - **Example**: Rushing model deployment without proper validation to meet presentation deadline
   - **Risk**: Technical debt; bugs in production; academic integrity concerns

4. **Communication Breakdowns**:
   - **Scenario**: Misunderstandings due to unclear requirements, language barriers, or assumptions
   - **Example**: Feature implemented differently than expected due to ambiguous specifications
   - **Risk**: Rework; wasted effort; interpersonal tension

5. **Skill Development Frustrations**:
   - **Scenario**: Members struggling with AI/ML concepts feeling inadequate or slowing team progress
   - **Example**: Difficulty understanding matrix factorization mathematics causing implementation delays
   - **Risk**: Disengagement; knowledge gaps; compromised learning objectives

6. **Commitment Level Disparities**:
   - **Scenario**: Varying levels of dedication and time investment creating inequity
   - **Example**: Some members available daily while others contribute minimally
   - **Risk**: Team cohesion breakdown; unfair grade distribution

### Conflict Resolution Framework:

#### Step 1: **Early Identification & Prevention**
- **Regular Check-ins**: Weekly team health surveys assessing satisfaction, workload, and concerns
- **Open Culture**: Encourage voicing concerns early before escalation
- **Transparent Metrics**: Visible contribution tracking (commits, reviews, meeting attendance) to identify imbalances
- **Proactive Adjustments**: Redistribute tasks if patterns of inequity emerge

#### Step 2: **Direct Communication**
- **One-on-One Discussion**: Involved parties meet privately to understand perspectives and find common ground
- **Active Listening**: Each person explains their viewpoint without interruption; summarize to confirm understanding
- **Focus on Interests**: Identify underlying needs rather than positions (e.g., "I need to learn ML" vs. "I want this task")
- **Timeline**: Attempt resolution within 48 hours of conflict identification

#### Step 3: **Team Mediation**
- **If unresolved**: Bring issue to full team meeting with neutral facilitator (rotating role)
- **Structured Discussion**: Each side presents perspective (5 min); team asks clarifying questions; brainstorm solutions
- **Democratic Decision**: When applicable, team votes on path forward with majority rule
- **Documentation**: Record decision rationale and agreed actions in meeting notes

#### Step 4: **Project Manager Intervention**
- **Escalation Trigger**: Conflicts affecting project timeline or team morale unresolved after 1 week
- **Suicheng Lai (PM)** facilitates discussion with authority to make binding decisions
- **Objective Assessment**: Review facts, contributions, and fairness of proposals
- **Decision**: PM makes final call prioritizing project success and team equity

#### Step 5: **Academic Advisor Consultation**
- **Last Resort**: Fundamental disagreements threatening project viability or academic integrity
- **Formal Process**: Written summary of conflict, attempted resolutions, and proposed solutions submitted to advisor
- **Advisor Guidance**: Leverage faculty expertise and authority for resolution
- **Grade Implications**: In extreme cases, individual assessments may be warranted

### Conflict Prevention Strategies:

1. **Clear Documentation**: All requirements, architecture decisions, and task assignments documented in writing
2. **Regular Retrospectives**: Bi-weekly sprint retrospectives identifying what's working and what needs improvement
3. **Pair Programming**: Collaborative coding sessions reduce misunderstandings and promote knowledge sharing
4. **Celebration of Wins**: Acknowledge milestones and individual contributions to maintain morale
5. **Psychological Safety**: Foster environment where mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures
6. **Work-Life Balance**: Respect boundaries; discourage late-night messages unless urgent
7. **Skill Development Time**: Allocate 20% of sprint time for learning and experimentation without pressure

### Team Agreement:

**We, the undersigned, commit to:**
- **Respect**: Value diverse perspectives and expertise; assume positive intent
- **Transparency**: Communicate honestly about challenges, capacity, and concerns
- **Accountability**: Own commitments; notify team immediately if unable to deliver
- **Collaboration**: Prioritize team success over individual recognition
- **Growth Mindset**: Embrace learning opportunities; support each other's development
- **Professionalism**: Maintain constructive tone in all communications; critique ideas, not people
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing circumstances; support teammates during difficult periods

**Conflict Resolution Commitment:**
We agree to address conflicts promptly, respectfully, and constructively using the framework above. We recognize that disagreements are natural in collaborative work and commit to resolving them in ways that strengthen rather than divide our team.
